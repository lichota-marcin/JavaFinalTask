The program should allow one to:

1. Determine - considering the current date - when the student will complete the course;
2. Calculate how many days and hours the student still has before the end of the program or how many days and hours ago the student completed the course;
3. Student data is set in code;
4. Unit tests to cover the most important methods (assuming that unit testing framework dependency could be added using Maven/Gradle)

Report methods are in ReportPrinter's main method, they print all required information.

There are few tests for methods that calculate date and time, inside CalculatorTest class.
